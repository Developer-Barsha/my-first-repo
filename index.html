    <h3>Always try to think positively</h3>
    <p>Speaking in the positive is expressing an idea, thinking a thought or asking a question in a way which moves towards what you want instead of away from what you don't want. For example “don't be horrible to me” is asking for what you don't want (negative tense) and “be nice to me” is what you do want (positive tense).</p>
